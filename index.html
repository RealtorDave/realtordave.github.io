									<h4>What is Leukemia and What Causes It</h4>
									<p align="justify"><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic0.jpg" alt="" /></span>Leukemia is the cancer of the blood and bone marrow. It is the rapid growth of abnormal cells in the bone marrow, the blood making tissue. It suppresses the production of normal blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It usually results in an extremely elevated count of defective white blood cells. Normally, white blood cells account for 1% of your blood volume (around 4000-10000 cells) and are meant to fight infection. Not only are leukemia cells bad at fighting infection, they hurt the ability of red blood cells and platelets to do their jobs. This happens because leukemia causes an overproduction of blast cells. Blast cells are basically the stem cells of blood. These blast cells don't properly develop and don't mature into blood cells. These blast cells eventually outnumber normal blood cells so that they cannot do their jobs. Unlike other cancers, leukemia doesn’t form a tumor that can be found by x-rays. Leukemia starts when the DNA of a single cell in the bone marrow changes (mutation) and can’t continue to function normally. It is currently unknown what causes the initial DNA mutation, however, there are some theories. Most studies show that leukemia is hereditary. It is also said that Artificial Ionising Radiation (radiation from xray tubes and particle accelerators) can cause leukemia. </p>

									<h2>What Systems does Leukemia Affect</h2>
									<p>Leukemia affects multiple systems directly and indirectly. Here is an explanation of what it does to each system.</p>
									<div class="features">
										<article>
											<a href="http://leukemia.cf/index.html#three" class="image"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h3>Circulatory System</h3>
												<p align="justify">Since leukemia is blood cancer, leukemia directly affects the circulatory system. Here are a few ways:<br>
													⚫Leukemia subdues the creation of normal blood cells<br>
													⚫Increased production of defective white blood cells<br>
													⚫Defective cells vastly outnumber good cells and hinder their ability to properly function<br>
													⚫Due to the increase in white blood cells, blood vessels can get clogged<br>
													⚫If there are too many cancer cells in the bone marrow, the bone marrow can clog up, which causes no blood to be released into blood vessels at all. This creates further problems like anemia.
												</p>
											</div>
										</article>

											<a href="http://leukemia.cf/index.html#three" class="image"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h3>Skeletal System</h3>
												<p align="justify">Leukemia both directly and indirectly affects the skeletal system<br>
													⚫Leukemia causes joint and bone pain<br>
													⚫This is because bone marrow becomes overcrowded with cancer cells. These cancer cells can form masses near joints and the nerves of the spinal cord, causing pain<br>
													⚫Leukemia also caused bone thinning, similar to osteoporosis
												</p>

										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="http://leukemia.cf/index.html#three" class="image"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h3>Digestive System</h3>
												<p align="justify">Leukemia does not directly have an affect on the digestive system, however several factors that affect other systems translate into issues with the digestive system. Here's a list: <br>
													⚫Due to a lack of platelets, your gums can bleed easily. This leads to mouth discomfort and makes it very hard to eat<br>
													⚫Leukemia cells can gather in your liver, causing bloating. This gives you a sense of "fullness", which makes it hard to eat<br>
													⚫Treatments for leukemia, like chemotherapy and radiation, cause nausea and vomiting. This leads to a lack of appetite

								<h3>Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
								<p>This section will talk about how leukemia is diagnosed and how it can be treated.</p>
								<div class="features">
									<article>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<div class="inner">
											<h4>How is Leukemia Diagnosed?</h4>
											<p align="justify">Leukemia is usually first diagnosed during routine blood tests or if a patient experienced unusual symptoms. A doctor will perform these tests to properly diagnose a patient.<br>
												⚫Physical Exam: A doctor will look for signs of leukemia, such as bloating of the liver or pale skin from anemia<br>
												⚫Blood Test: A doctor will look for abnormal levels of red or white blood cells or platelets through a blood test which may indicate leukemia. A blood test can, in some cases, show the presence of leukemia cells.<br>
												⚫Bone Marrow Test: This final test definitively tells a healthcare professional if you have leukemia. A doctor will remove a sample of bone marrow from your hipbone. Bone marrow is removed withg a long, thin needle and is sent to a laboratory to look for leukemia cells.<br><br>
											   Leukemia is diagnosed this way because leukemia originates in the bone marrow and circulates into blood vessels. By testing the area of origination, you can be sure of the type of disease you have.

										<div class="inner">
											<h4>How Can Leukemia be Treated?</h4>
											<p>Although there is no cure for leukemia, there are some treatments available that can be used to mitigate some of the symptoms and potentially increase the lifespan of the patient. These treatments are:<br>
												⚫Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is the most common form of treatment for leukemia. It is basically a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells.<br>
												⚫Radiation Therapy: This treatment uses X-Rays to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. This treatment can also be used to prepare for a bone marrow transplant.<br>
												⚫Bone Marrow Transplant: A bone marrow transplant, or stem cell transplant, helps restore healthy stem cells by replacing leukemia infected bone marrow with healthy stem cells. These healthy stem cells will regenerate healthy bone marrow.
